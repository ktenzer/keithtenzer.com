<p>The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2015 annual report for this blog.</p>
<p><a href="http://keithtenzer.com/2015/annual-report/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/12/2014-emailteaser.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>The concert hall at the Sydney Opera House holds 2,700 people. This blog was viewed about <strong>56,000</strong> times in 2015. If it were a concert at Sydney Opera House, it would take about 21 sold-out performances for that many people to see it.</p></blockquote>
