    Good morning Keith, <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy name is Isaac Gonzalez and I am emailing
    you on behalf of the OpenStack Foundation. We recently came across your blog post
    on integrating OpenStack use cases with Ceph (https://keithtenzer.com/2016/09/12/openstack-integrating-ceph-as-storage-backend/)
    and were wondering if we could syndicate it on our Superuser online publication
    (superuser.openstack.org) with full credit given to you and your site. <br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nIf this sounds like something you'd be interested in, please feel free to
    reply to me at the email listed. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you, <br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nIsaac Gonzalez <br />\r\nOpenStack Foundation<br /><br />\n\nTime: September
