    Keith, <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope this finds you well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI've
    been fiddling around (on and off) with Openstack for the last year or so. I've
    already got COA and EX210 v10 certifications too, so I believe I have a good starting
    foundation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm currently going to study for EX310 v10. However,
    I feel like I'm still not solid enough on the installation/architecture parts
    of Openstack. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor instance, all that I've been using the in
    the past are PackStack and TripleO Quick start on VMs on my home server. I don't
    have any production Openstack installations around to work on. So I need to make
    my own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI tried to step it up by creating a TripleO installation
    on ESXi (Multiple VMs, fake_pxe, and so on) I tried it with Openstack Newton and
    it failed, and I'm also struggling at it now with Pike. Introspection and initial
    overcloud deployment all seem to work well, but seems like quirks in configurations
    that I'm missing are breaking it at some point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI looked around
    for any full guide on how to deploy TripleO on ESXi but none were found (using
    anything but RHEL).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I thought I'd ask if you have any information,
    or do you offer anything in related to Openstack (private classes, mentorship,
    etc) that I can learn from?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks in advance,<br />\r\nAmeen.<br
