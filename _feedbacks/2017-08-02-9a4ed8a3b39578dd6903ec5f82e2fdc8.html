    Hey Keith,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust wanted to chat about Heat.  We are thinking
    about use it and I'm just learning as much as I can.  If you have 15 minute I
    would love to webex.  If you are in the SoCal area I would love to invite you
    on campus to show you around.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTed Malaska<br /><br />\n\nTime:
