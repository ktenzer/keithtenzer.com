    different virtualisation managers trying to find what is better for our specific
    problem and i would like your input on it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will create a
    number of small (5-10 servers max) \"remote datacenter\" that are connected to
    the \"internet\" over sat link (so bandwidth is a big issue).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe
    tried OpenStack but soon realised it was an overkill for the size of the datacenters
    we have and the amount of work required to set it up and manage/maintain it after.<br
    />\r\nWe briefly looked at cloudstack, but given its state we are not sure if
    its the correct option for a long-running project.<br />\r\nRecently we have been
    playing around with RHEV-H/RHEV-M in a local setup to get some first hand experience.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat we are not sure if RHEV-M would operate in the limited bandwidth
    environment we have when it has to handle more than 50 RHEV-H \"datacenters\"
    or we have to deploy one RHEV-M in every remote location to handle the local servers
    and then write our own management code using the SDK/API to manage the RHEV-M
    instances.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven your experience i would appreciate your input
    on how we could architect a system like that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you again
