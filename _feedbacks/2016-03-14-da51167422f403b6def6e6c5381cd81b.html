    Dear Keith,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI saw your experience and the work you have done.
    Really impressive! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou probably are not looking for a new
    position as Red Hat is really cool. (I met a speaker at the nodejs event in Amsterdam.)
    But nevertheless in the future if you ever decide to make a change please think
    of IceMobile. The company is always looking for people that create new things
    that have never been done before especially for our Cloud Engineering team. We
    are currently looking for a senior to lead that team and take them to them next
    level. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope to stay in contact with you and send you a invitation
    to connect via linkedin. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you in advance and have an
    amazing day. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith kind regards,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSaskia
