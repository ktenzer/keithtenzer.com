    your post, CI/CD with Ansible Tower and GitHub. I tried to configure the same
    function on my trial ansible tower server today. I was able repeat all the steps
    in your except the trigger did not work between my GitHub repository and my ansible
    tower server. I have documented and screenshot all the steps I did. I am still
    confused about the webhook configuration part on the GitHub repository. I think
    I could misconfigured that part. I am wondering if you can review my screenshots
    and correct my configuration on that part? I would really appreciate it.<br />\r\n<br
