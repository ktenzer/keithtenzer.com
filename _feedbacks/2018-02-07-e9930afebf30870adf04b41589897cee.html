    Hi Keith!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan I interview you via Skype in the next few weeks?
    I ran across several presentations that you have done, from your Kubernetes and
    OpenShift &amp; Why Containers Are So Cool YouTube video to the fantastic Red
    Hat OpenStack Platform 10 (Newton) Installation and Configuration Guide that you
    did here.  That guide my colleague and I both found helpful!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe
    would like to interview you on Scale Your Code, where we could talk about any
    of the challenges you may have faced at Red Hat as it relates to containers, and
    even OpenStack, and what you think the future looks like for those technologies.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis interview would be published on http://scaleyourcode.com/interviews
    and promoted via social media, as well as by our other brands. Scale Your Code
    is integrated into the Linux Academy platform (where I work!), which was recently
    named the fastest growing private education company on the Inc. 500 List – so
    this episode would have a significant reach. We've also had guests like David
    H. Hansson, Jeff Atwood, and Jeremy Edberg.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks!<br />\r\nStephen
