    Howdy,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis might be a dumb question, but I'm studying for
    the Ex310K exam (after failing it once) &amp; Ceph/Cinder config is throwing me
    for a loop. I've been studying your setup guides for a while, &amp; even talked
    to one of your colleagues at Summit earlier this month about another backend-related
    issue but I'm still kind of hung up on figuring out the fastest config steps for
    getting ceph running with Cinder when using Packstack. Is it recommended to change
    'config_cinder_backend' from lvm to rbd in the packstack answer file, &amp; if
    that's good practice, I'm assuming that volume groups should be disabled? The
    answer file doesn't list rbd or anything I recognize as being associated with
    ceph as a valid option which I think is what's confusing me. Is it better to just
    disable 'cinder_volumes_create' then configure ceph? I really appreciate any guidance
    you can offer, &amp; I appreciate all of the comprehensive guides you've posted
    so far. They've been integral in understanding how Ceph works. Thanks!<br /><br
