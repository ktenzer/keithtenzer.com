    Hello,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is probably kind of random, but I'm getting ready
    to do a course for Linux Academy about OpenShift on OpenStack, &amp; as one of
    my favorite sources for OpenStack info - I was wondering if it would be okay if
    I incorporated a modified version of your OoO-123 Ansible playbooks into my course
    (with credit of course)? Feel free to email me treva[at]linuxacademy[dot]com<br
