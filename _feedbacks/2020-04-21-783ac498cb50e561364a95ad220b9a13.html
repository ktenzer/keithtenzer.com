    Hello,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am reaching out to you because I’m doing some research
    for a mental health &amp; wellness campaign I’m working on related to Covid-19
    (Coronavirus). I was looking at a page of your site here ( &#091;https://keithtenzer.com/2020/03/05/the-great-human-experiment-global-disconnection-from-coronavirus/&#093;
    ), so thought I'd would contact you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have been featured in
    Yahoo, ADAA, TheMighty, AMHCA, GoodMenProject, ThriveGlobal, HealthComU, etc...
    and as a result, the mental health of individuals &amp; families is something
    I'm quite passionate about; especially as we deal with Covid-19 globally. <br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nWith that said, I'm involved with an important project that is
    focused on educating people about mental health-related topics and more recently
    Coronavirus by possibly working with websites like yours. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn
    short, I'm trying to find websites that are open to continuing to publish content
    on this topic even if it requires a sponsorship fee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you
    are interested in hearing more about the project, please let me know. If not,
    I understand and don’t necessarily expect a response from you. Whatever you decide,
    thanks for your consideration &amp; time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMarie<br /><br /><br
