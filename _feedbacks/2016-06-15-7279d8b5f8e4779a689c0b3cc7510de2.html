    Hi Keith,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was following your document to setup RHEL OpenStack
    Platform 8.<br />\r\nYou mention in your steps about \"stack\" user on KVM Hypervisor
    Host. Did you create that user (and I assume you just didn't show the creation
    step on KVM hypervisor host)?<br />\r\nAnd if so, why should we create a stack
    user on KVM Hypervisor host.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks much<br />\r\n-Raj<br /><br

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>I was following your document to setup RHEL OpenStack Platform 8.<br />
You mention in your steps about "stack" user on KVM Hypervisor Host. Did you create that user (and I assume you just didn't show the creation step on KVM hypervisor host)?<br />
And if so, why should we create a stack user on KVM Hypervisor host.</p>
<p>Thanks much<br />
