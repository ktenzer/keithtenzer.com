    Hi Keith, <br />\r\nI want to adapt former SnapCreator POSTGRES plug-in for SnapCenter
    usage. I've got a couple of questions regarding variables in the module code,
    May I validate my thoughts with you as you're the author of most snapcreator code?
    If you don't mind, please write me back via email and I'll describe it more detailed.
    <br />\r\nThank you, <br />\r\nAnton<br /><br />\n\nTime: September 5, 2017 at
