    <b>Comment:</b> hello Keith. I was working on getting some openstack nodes running in some virtual machines and came across one of your blog posts. i'm using a windows host and virtualbox. i have rhel installed and my undercloud is deployed. i'm getting as far as importing the json and running openstack baremetal configure boot. i can't figure out how to get baremetal vm's in virtualbox.. i'm not sure if it's possible? it seems you are using virt-install as a workaround, having the vms created under kvm instead. can you elaborate a little on this section?<br /><br />
