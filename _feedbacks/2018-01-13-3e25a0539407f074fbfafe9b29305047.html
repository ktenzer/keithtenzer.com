    <b>Comment:</b> Hi Keith; Hopefully you are doing good. By following your blog I am trying to deploy OOO, but facing few challenges. I wonder if I can get your kind support on it. I have Redhat VM acting as OSPD and Centos VM acting as hypervisor. I was unable to understand why physical interfaces are bonded in  xml scripts while defining provisioning and external network, so I simply configured Linux bridges. Under cloud got  installed successfully but once I tried to register overcloud VMs it got failed then by searching many document I used fake_pxe instead of pxe_ssh deriver type and registration completed successfully.  But introspection again failed. I am stuck here. I wonder if I can get your support. I can pay for your time.<br /><br />
