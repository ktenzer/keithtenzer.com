    Hi Keith,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have been following some of your tutorials about
    Openshift Enterprise and found them very helpful. I am working in a bank and part
    of a team where we are building DevOps pipeline. We have decided to use Openshift
    Enterprise solution. I see that can provide coaching services - does it mean that
    you manage training sessions also? I very much would like to discuss about Openshift
    training sessions + some deep architecture discussions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHope
    to hear from you soon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegards,<br />\r\nImran Mughal<br /><br
