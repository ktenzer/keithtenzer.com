<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>thank you for the great article at http://keithtenzer.com/2015/02/16/building-custom-dashboards-in-openstack-horizon/</p>
<p>It really helped me a lot so far developing my own custom dashboard.<br />
However, I'm stuck at a use case where I need to create a form inside a tab.<br />
For example in dashboards/project/instances there are several tabs within instance details (console, action log, etc.)</p>
<p>I would like to know how to have a form inside a tab without having a modal form (fullscreen) like it is the case for a workflow.<br />
Do you know if this is possible and if it could be done?<br />
I didn't find any useful example yet during my search.</p>
<p>Would be glad to hear from you.</p>
