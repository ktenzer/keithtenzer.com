    <b>Comment:</b> Hello, I work doing lead generation for Red Hat. I have had to teach myself the ins and outs of all the solutions. I am getting some traction with cloudforms, it seems you know this area well. I have a question, does cloudforms require a company to have an onsite RHEL or Linux presence? How does it work in environments where the company is over mostly cloud based?<br /><br />
