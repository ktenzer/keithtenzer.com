<p>There is something romantic about coding, the flickering of the monitor, your ideas coming to life, no rules and in the darkness of night when your are too tired to think of why something cannot be done, a magical moment may just happen. <!--more-->For the "midnight code junkie" it is about these moments of discovery, charting a path to the unknown and of course the journey itself. It isn't about user stories, scrums, or a software product...no it is just beautiful code that you create and most importantly share. In our wildest of dreams such code could one day come to life and be something useful to society. We code for those moments, when job and family time allow as we are "midnight code junkies".</p>
<p>If you're a "midnight code junkie" then speak up, tell your story, you are not alone!</p>
