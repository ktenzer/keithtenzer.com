<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I have over 20 years of enterprise IT experience. Have a strong software engineering background but also worked on infrastructure side, as a Linux systems and storage administrator. Worked for several high-profile companies such as Intuit, NetApp and Red Hat, both the USA and Europe. Through my career, I focused a lot of time around application integration and built distinct expertise in this area. Currently my focus is to help large enterprise organizations move toward containerization and building next-gen platforms. Opinions expressed in this blog are my own and do not necessarily reflect that of the company I work for.</p>
<h3>Software Engineering Accomplishments</h3>
<p>Coding provides a creative outlet for many of my ideas. It also helps to understand how software is built and operates. I have worked on several software engineering projects and some notable ones are mentioned below.</p>
<ul>
